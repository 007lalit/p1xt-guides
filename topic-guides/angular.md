# Angular - Topic Deep Dive

The following is a deep dive, designed to familiarize you thoroughly with Angular. It is not the "easy path to just learning 'enough'" - it aims far highter, combining thorough study of the official docs, regular practice projects, comprehensive exploration of TypeScript, Karma, Jasmine, and Protractor and hands on non-Angular TypeScript practice to ensure a rock solid foundation in everything Angular.
